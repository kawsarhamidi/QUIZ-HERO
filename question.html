<h1>Question 1.  difference between foreach map find and filter </h1>
<p>forEach() is used when you want to perform an action on each element in the array, map() is used when you want to modify each element in the array and create a new array with those modified values, find() is used when you want to find a specific element in the array based on a certain condition, and filter() is used when you want to create a new array with only the elements that meet a certain condition.</p>

    Question 2. difference between local storage and session storage and cookies
</h1>
<p>
    localStorage and sessionStorage are used for client-side storage in web applications, while cookies are used for both client-side and server-side storage. localStorage and sessionStorage are similar in that they are both key-value stores that are accessible only within the domain and protocol where they were created, but they differ in terms of their persistence and lifetime. cookies are different in that they are sent from a website to the user's browser and can be accessed across multiple domains and protocols.

    Question 3. What is an event loop
</h1>
<p>
    In this way, JavaScript can handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main thread of execution. However, it's important to note that because JavaScript is single-threaded, long-running tasks can still block the event loop and cause performance issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to use asynchronous techniques like callbacks, promises, and async/await to delegate work to other parts of the browser or runtime environment.
