<h1>Question 1.  difference between foreach map find and filter </h1>

    Question 2. difference between local storage and session storage and cookies
</h1>
<p>
    localStorage and sessionStorage are used for client-side storage in web applications, while cookies are used for both client-side and server-side storage. <br> localStorage and sessionStorage are similar in that they are both key-value stores that are accessible only within the domain and protocol where they were created, but they differ in terms of their persistence and lifetime. <br> cookies are different in that they are sent from a website to the user's browser and can be accessed across multiple domains and protocols.

    Question 3. What is an event loop
</h1>
<p>
    In this way, JavaScript can handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main thread of execution. <br> However, it's important to note that because JavaScript is single-threaded, long-running tasks can still block the event loop and cause performance issues. <br> To avoid this, it's recommended to use asynchronous techniques like callbacks, promises, and async/await to delegate work to other parts of the browser or runtime environment.
